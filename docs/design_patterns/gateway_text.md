# Gateway 
A gateway is "[a]n object that encapsulates access to an external system or resource." (Fowler 2011, S. 466). This object is basically an applied wrapper pattern. The gateway is then used to translate the external API into a simple object or method call inside the application (vgl. ebd., S. 466f). 

Gateways also offer a great opportunity to implement a _Service Stub_ (See TODO link) that simulates the external API for testing (vgl. ebd., S. 467). It can therefor provide functionality that beyond the simple translation of external resources.
