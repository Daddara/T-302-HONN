We implemented the setter injection into the view file in weather_gateway.
How it works is that the instance of WeatherApiWeatherGateway() is
initialized in the __init__.py and access in views. Views doesn't know what
GATEWAY is and it doesn't need to know. That way, GATEWAY is set outside of
views. This can't be done with a global variable since Djanga doesn't use
classes, thats why we had to import the variable instead of using a setter
inside of views.
