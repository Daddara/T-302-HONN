## What went well 
* The sprint went pretty smooth
* The work distribution is getting better, we started making merge requests sooner
* Good communication within the team

## What went badly
* We still have late merge requests on Sundays which is not good
* Our merge requests are too large
* We didn't have the decision protocol in the last sprint and no one was
responsible for that, we should fix that for the next sprint

## What could have gone better
* We could have made smaller merge requests more frequently
