# Decision protocol: Sprint 2
Note: This was created afterwards as it seams like we've lost track of this task. This protocol will therefor not contain the attendees of each meeting. This information was taken from the email conversation with Gunnar

## **TA meeting** on Tuesday 08.09.20 at 10:10:
- We decided to implement/document the following design patterns:
    1. Layer Supertype
    2. Plug-in
    3. Service Stub
    4. Gateway System
    5. Mapper
    6. Registry Pattern
- New user stories:
    - #51 As a user I would like to be able to view my profile, so that I can see my relevant information.
    - #52 As a user I would like to see what the weather is like today, so I can decide what exercise I'm doing.
    - #53 As a user I want to be able to schedule workouts.
- Our sprint goal is to implement the following user stories:
    - #2, #5, #9, #12, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18, #19, #24, #27, #51, #52

## **Standup** on Friday 11.09.20 at 12:00:
- No important decisions

## **TA meeting** on Tuesday 15.09.20 at 10:10:
- We decided to implement different design pattern because our previous patterns would most likely satisfy the requirements:
    1. Gateway
    2. Value Object
    3. Service Stub
    4. Registry Pattern
    5. Mapper
    6. Layer Supertype
- We added a new user story:
    - #56 As a user I would like to be able to donate money to workout creators that I like, so I can show them my appreciation
