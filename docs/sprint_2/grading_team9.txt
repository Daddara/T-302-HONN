10. Lecture aspects:
    - Conditional pass:
        - Registry: I find it a stretch to call settings.py a Registry even though it might roughly fit the description.
        - Service stub: a service stub is not just a single function it is usually a class, 
                        what you should have done instead is created something like a gateway for the paypal interface 
                        and then had two/three implementations, one for the sandbox, one for production and one as a stub.
        - The Gateway pattern is not the Mapper pattern.
