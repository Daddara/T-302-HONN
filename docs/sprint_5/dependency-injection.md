A Dependency Injection means that an object receives other object that it depends on. We implemented a Constructor Dependency Injection and it is instantiated in WeatherService(). It takes a WeatherGateway object as a construction argument to get either current weather or weather forecast. The reason we use it here is to have the Gateway replaceable. The WeatherAPI we are using has a usage limit for instance. We might want to replace it with a cheeper or better option
