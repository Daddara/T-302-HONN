## Constraints

### No actual users

Since our application is not and will not be officially launched it will not have *real* users.
Our only users are us, the people working on the project, and maybe friends and family members asked 
to test the usability of our application

### Paypal Connection is not official

Again since the application isn't going to be officially launched and this is a school project we don't have official 
partnership with paypal and though we simulate a paypal payment system connection we will not actually have that.

### Only one Database

Our application depends on a single database, which means there will be no system distribution

### Component independence

Only two components in our application are independent (weather-api and logging server) 
and can be removed without issues. Rest of the system is fully linked.

### Limited Pipeline

Our pipeline time is limited and can only run a certain amount of tests over a period of time.
