##What went well 
* We are more cooperative, working well together asking and answering questions
* Good communication within the team
* Good communication with the teachers, cleared things up 
* We passed sprint 1
* We added a coverage report and the coverage is quite high
##What went badly
* Kind of lost track of where we are in the sprint
##What could have gone better
* Less conditional passes in Sprint 1
* We could have gotten the comments on Sprint 1 sooner so that we could improve Sprint 2
* We could have started working on our user stories sooner, would have made things less chaotic
